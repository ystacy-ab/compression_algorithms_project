Once upon a time, in a village by the river, there lived a baker.  
The baker baked bread every morning. The bread was warm, the bread was fresh, the bread was delicious.  
The villagers loved the bread. Every morning, the villagers would walk to the bakery.  
Every morning, the smell of fresh bread filled the air.  
Every morning, the baker would smile.  
Every morning, the villagers would greet the baker.  
Every morning, the baker would say, Good morning! Fresh bread for everyone!

In the evening, the baker would rest.  
In the evening, the village would be quiet.  
In the evening, the river would flow softly.  
In the evening, the stars would shine.  
In the evening, the baker would dream of bread.  
In the evening, the villagers would dream of bread.

This happened every day.  
Every day the sun would rise.  
Every day the villagers would wake.  
Every day the baker would bake.  
Every day the bread would be warm.  
Every day the bread would be fresh.  
Every day the bread would be delicious.  
Every day the smell of bread would bring joy.

The bread was round. The bread was golden. The bread was soft.  
The bread was loved. The bread was shared.  
The bread was the heart of the village.  
And so it was, every day, every evening, every morning bread, love, and joy.
